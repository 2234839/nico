-----------------

Rethink the design of spm.

## The core

Every function in the core should be a MUST-HAVE feature. Obviously, coffee is not in the core.

Think about compress, for example uglifyjs. It is not in the core either.
It's not a MUST-HAVE feature.

When we install spm, we install the core.

### The plugins


## Inject code

````js
var a = "a"
````
