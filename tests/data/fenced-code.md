Nico is designed friendly for Front-End developer.

## Inject Code

You can inject code into the page by 4 \`, for example:

    ````js
    var nico = 'hello';
    ````

We support javascript, css, html.

### A real example

You can view the source by inspector.

Javascript:

````js
var nico = 'hello';
````

CSS:

````css
#a-real-example {
    color: red;
}
````

HTML:

````html
<a href="javascript:;">hello nico</a>
````


## Inject code without highlight

Just inject, not show on the page with 5 \`;

`````js
var nico = 'hello';
`````


`````css
#a-real-example {
    color: red;
}
`````

`````html
<a href="javascript:;">hello nico</a>
`````
