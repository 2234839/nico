nico is a front-end friendly static site generator, best for web developers like you and me.

Ever want to build a static site? Don't fancy Python, Ruby or any other languages? Just like you, I do like javascript, and node made it so fun.

nico is written in javascript, using what you are familiar with makes you happy. You are able to change things, you are able to make a difference.

## Quality

The concept is borrowed from [liquidluck](http://lab.lepture.com/liquidluck/) with a little improvement. It should works like liquidluck, and it really did.

The code of nico is well tested, and you can add more test case for this project.
Have a lookt at the [test coverage](./coverage.html') and find out the missing test case.
