Wow, you are surfing the documentation, good to hear that.

I belive you have installed nico, but I would like to repeat this part.

Install nico is simple with npm:

```
$ npm install nico -g
```

Please install it with ``-g`` option, otherwise you can't use it in command line.

For Windows User, please check <https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp>, and install the missing requirements.
